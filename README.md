# Blackjack

Blackjack_Project Creating a simple Blackjack game in Python involves simulating the game rules, handling card decks, and making decisions based on the player's and dealer's hands. Below is a Python script that implements the basic features of Blackjack, where a player competes against a virtual dealer.

Features:
Deck of Cards: The deck is shuffled at the start of each game.
Player Decision: The player can choose to "hit" (get another card) or "stand" (keep the current hand).
Score Calculation: The score is calculated based on the total value of the cards in hand. Aces can count as either 1 or 11.
Dealer Logic: The dealer will hit until they have at least 17 points.
Explanation:
Card Class: Represents individual cards, including their rank and suit.
Deck Class: Handles the deck of cards, shuffling, and dealing cards.
Hand Class: Represents the player's or dealer's hand and computes the total score, accounting for aces that can be either 1 or 11.
Gameplay Flow:
The player and dealer are dealt two cards each.
The player can choose to "hit" (draw a card) or "stand" (end their turn).
The dealer will keep hitting until they reach a score of 17 or higher.
The player and dealer's final scores are compared to determine the winner.
Sample Gameplay:
Welcome to Blackjack!

Features:
Card shuffling: The deck is shuffled each time a new game begins.
Player decisions: The player can choose whether to hit or stand.
Dealer logic: The dealer follows the rule of hitting until they have 17 or more points.
Score handling: Aces are counted as 11 or 1 depending on the score.
You can further extend this by adding additional features like betting, multiple rounds, or a GUI using libraries like tkinter.
